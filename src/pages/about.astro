                My journey didn't start in a cloud server—it started in ceilings, crawlspaces, and server closets.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                I began my career as an IT support specialist, running a small Managed Service Provider (MSP). That hands-on experience led me into the world of **low voltage infrastructure**: structured cabling, surveillance systems, and commercial AV installations for bars, restaurants, and high-end homes.

            <h3 class="text-gray-200">The Analog-Digital Convergence</h3>
            <p>
                I also trained as an electrical apprentice during a pivotal shift in the industry: the crossover from analog to digital.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked alongside "old school" analog electricians who took me under their wing, teaching me the physical craft—pulling wire, bending conduit, and understanding the raw power that drives everything. In return, I became their bridge to the digital world, introducing them to IP addressing, network segmentation, and the software logic that was beginning to control their hardware.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-gray-200">The Evolution to AI Engineering</h3>
            <p>
                Today, I apply that same "full-stack" philosophy—from the physical layer to the application layer—to Artificial Intelligence. I don't just write prompts; I build the infrastructure that powers them.
            </p>
            <p>
                My focus is on **Self-Hosted, Sovereign AI**. Using tools like Docker, Ollama, Qdrant, and Mem0, I build systems that own their data, remember their context, and operate efficiently on your own hardware.
